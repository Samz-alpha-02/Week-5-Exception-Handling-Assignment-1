    "An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of \n",
    "instructions. When an exception is encountered, the program's execution is halted, and the control is transferred \n",
    "to a suitable exception handler.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cause: Exceptions are typically caused by errors in the program logic or unexpected conditions during runtime, \n",
    "          while syntax errors are caused by violating the rules of the Python language's syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Detection: Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase before the program is \n",
    "              executed. In contrast, exceptions are detected during program execution when a specific condition \n",
    "              or situation occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling: Syntax errors need to be fixed by correcting the syntax in the code before the program can be executed \n",
    "             successfully. On the other hand, exceptions can be caught and handled using exception handling mechanisms\n",
    "             such as try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully handle errors and continue execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Types: Syntax errors are specific to the language syntax rules and can include errors like missing colons, \n",
    "          mismatched parentheses, or invalid variable names. Exceptions, on the other hand, come in various types and \n",
    "          can include errors like division by zero (ZeroDivisionError), accessing an index beyond the bounds of a list \n",
    "          (IndexError), or trying to open a file that does not exist (FileNotFoundError).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Control flow: Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all until they are fixed, as the interpreter cannot \n",
    "                 parse the code correctly. Exceptions, however, allow for more flexible control flow. When an exception \n",
    "                 occurs, the program flow is disrupted, and the control can be transferred to exception handlers, allowing\n",
    "                 for error recovery or displaying appropriate error messages.\n",
    "            \n",
    "In summary, exceptions are runtime errors that occur when a program is executed, while syntax errors are detected by the \n",
    "interpreter during the parsing phase. Exceptions can be caught and handled, providing a mechanism for error recovery, \n",
    "while syntax errors need to be fixed before the program can be executed successfully."
